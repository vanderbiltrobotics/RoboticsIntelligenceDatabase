# Robotics Inteligence Database
R.I.D. is a compilation of the combined knowledge and resources of Vanderbilt Robotics. This was designed to give members of the Vanderbilt Robotics club a centralized location that stores all the resources you need to create your robot. We will culminate all of our collective knowledge into this database to decrease the amount of daunting research you do to accomplish a task and to increase the efficiency of actually "doing robotics". If you cannot find something in the database that you need to know, please research it and, please, PLEASE, I BEG YOU, add the resources you find to this database; it could be in the form of links paragraphs, images, videos, etc. Topics in this database include mechanical design, electronics, programming, systems engineering and more. Below are resources that tell you how to navigate, contribute to, and use the database to the fullest, as well as team and club information.
